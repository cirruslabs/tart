# Privacy Policy

In addition to this Privacy Policy, Cirrus Labs also has a [Terms of Service](terms.md).

### The Gist

Cirrus Labs Inc will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use 
this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, 
not individuals.

We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal 
information, we won't do anything evil with it.

We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details 
before you use any of our sites.

### Reuse

This document is based upon the [Automattic Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under 
[Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, 
this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and 
you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse 
Cirrus Labs Inc or its use of the work.

Cirrus Labs Inc ("Cirrus Labs") makes available services include our web sites (https://tart.run/), our blog, our API, 
and any other software, sites, and services offered by Cirrus Labs Inc in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). 
It is Cirrus Labs Inc's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at hello@cirruslabs.org

### Visitors

Like most website operators, Cirrus Labs Inc collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and 
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 
Cirrus Labs Inc's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cirrus Labs Inc's 
visitors use its website. From time to time, Cirrus Labs Inc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, 
e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Cirrus Labs Inc also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
Cirrus Labs Inc does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, 
other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 
We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Cirrus Labs Inc's websites choose to interact with Cirrus Labs Inc in ways that require 
Cirrus Labs Inc to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cirrus Labs Inc gathers 
depends on the nature of the interaction. Cirrus Labs Inc collects such information only insofar as is necessary or 
appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Cirrus Labs Inc. Cirrus Labs Inc does not disclose 
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, 
with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, 
when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. 
Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

### Aggregated Statistics

Cirrus Labs Inc may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, Cirrus Labs Inc 
may monitor the most popular parts of the https://tart.run/. Cirrus Labs Inc may display this information publicly or 
provide it to others. However, Cirrus Labs Inc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Cirrus Labs Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, 
contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Cirrus Labs Inc's behalf 
or to provide services available at Cirrus Labs Inc's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. 
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, 
you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cirrus Labs Inc will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and 
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 
Cirrus Labs Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, 
or when Cirrus Labs Inc believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cirrus Labs Inc, 
third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Cirrus Labs Inc may 
occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with 
Cirrus Labs Inc and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep 
this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), 
we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 
Cirrus Labs Inc takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or 
destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Browser Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides 
to the Service each time the visitor returns. Cirrus Labs Inc uses cookies to help Cirrus Labs Inc identify and track visitors, 
their usage of Cirrus Labs Inc Service, and their Service access preferences. Cirrus Labs Inc visitors who do not wish to have 
cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Cirrus Labs Inc's websites, with 
the drawback that certain features of Cirrus Labs Inc's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Data Storage

Cirrus Labs Inc uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, 
storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, 
it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Cirrus Labs Inc may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, 
and in Cirrus Labs Inc's sole discretion. Cirrus Labs Inc encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes 
to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your 
acceptance of such change.
