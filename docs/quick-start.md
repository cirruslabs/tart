description: Install Tart and run your first virtual machine on Apple Silicon in minutes.
---

Try running a Tart VM on your Apple Silicon device running macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later (will download a 25 GB image):

```bash
brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-base:latest sequoia-base
tart run sequoia-base
```

??? info "Manual installation from a release archive"
    It's also possible to manually install `tart` binary from the latest released archive:

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/releases/latest/download/tart.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf tart.tar.gz
    ./tart.app/Contents/MacOS/tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-base:latest sequoia-base
    ./tart.app/Contents/MacOS/tart run sequoia-base
    ```

    Please note that `./tart.app/Contents/MacOS/tart` binary is required to be used in order to trick macOS
    to pick `tart.app/Contents/embedded.provisionprofile` for elevated privileges that Tart needs.

## VM images

The following macOS images are currently available:

* macOS 15 (Sequoia)
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-base:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-xcode:latest`
* macOS 14 (Sonoma)
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sonoma-vanilla:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sonoma-base:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sonoma-xcode:latest`
* macOS 13 (Ventura)
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-ventura-vanilla:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-ventura-base:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-ventura-xcode:latest`
* macOS 12 (Monterey)
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-monterey-vanilla:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-monterey-base:latest`
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-monterey-xcode:latest`

There's also a [full list of images](https://github.com/orgs/cirruslabs/packages?tab=packages&q=macos-) in which you can discovery specific tags (e.g. `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-monterey-xcode:15`) and [macOS-specific Packer templates](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates) that were used to generate these images.

For, Linux the options are as follows:

* Ubuntu
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest`
* Debian
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/debian:latest`
* Fedora
    * `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/fedora:latest`

Note that these Linux images have a minimal disk size of 20 GB, and you might want to resize them right after cloning:

```bash
tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest ubuntu
tart set ubuntu --disk-size 50
tart run ubuntu
```

These Linux images can be ran natively on [Vetu](https://github.com/cirruslabs/vetu), our virtualization solution for Linux, assuming that Vetu itself is running on an `arm64` machine.

Similarly to macOS, there's also a [full list of images](https://github.com/orgs/cirruslabs/packages?repo_name=linux-image-templates) in which you can discovery specific tags (e.g. `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:22.04`) and [Linux-specific Packer templates](https://github.com/cirruslabs/linux-image-templates) that were used to generate these images.

All images above use the following credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`

These credentials work both for logging in via GUI, console (Linux) and SSH.

## SSH access

If the guest VM is running and configured to accept incoming SSH connections you can conveniently connect to it like so:

```bash
ssh admin@$(tart ip sequoia-base)
```

!!! tip "Running scripts inside Tart virtual machines"
    We recommend using [Cirrus CLI](integrations/cirrus-cli.md) to run scripts and/or retrieve artifacts
    from within Tart virtual machines. Alternatively, you can use plain ssh connection and `tart ip` command:

    ```bash
    brew install cirruslabs/cli/sshpass
    sshpass -p admin ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" admin@$(tart ip sequoia-base) "uname -a"
    sshpass -p admin ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" admin@$(tart ip sequoia-base) < script.sh
    ```

## Creating VM images

Tart supports macOS and Linux virtual machines. All commands like `run` and `pull` work the same way regardless of the underlying OS a particular VM image has.
The only difference is how such VM images are created. Please check sections below for [macOS](#creating-a-macos-vm-image-from-scratch) and [Linux](#creating-a-linux-vm-image-from-scratch) instructions.

### Creating a macOS VM image from scratch

Tart can create VMs from `*.ipsw` files. You can download a specific `*.ipsw` file [here](https://ipsw.me/) or you can
use `latest` instead of a path to `*.ipsw` to download the latest available version:

```bash
tart create --from-ipsw=latest sequoia-vanilla
tart run sequoia-vanilla
```

After the initial booting of the VM, you'll need to manually go through the macOS installation process. As a convention we recommend creating an `admin` user with an `admin` password. After the regular installation please do some additional modifications in the VM:

1. Enable Auto-Login. Users & Groups -> Login Options -> Automatic login -> admin.
2. Allow SSH. Sharing -> Remote Login
3. Disable Lock Screen. Preferences -> Lock Screen -> disable "Require Password" after 5.
4. Disable Screen Saver.
5. Run `sudo visudo` in Terminal, find `%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL` add `admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to allow sudo without a password.

### Creating a Linux VM image from scratch

Linux VMs are supported on hosts running macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or newer.

```bash
# Create a bare VM
tart create --linux ubuntu

# Install Ubuntu
tart run --disk focal-desktop-arm64.iso ubuntu

# Run VM
tart run ubuntu
```

After the initial setup please make sure your VM can be SSH-ed into by running the following commands inside your VM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

### Configuring a VM

By default, a Tart VM uses 2 CPUs and 4 GB of memory with a `1024x768` display. This can be changed after VM creation with `tart set` command.
Please refer to `tart set --help` for additional details.

## Mounting directories

To mount a directory, run the VM with the `--dir` argument:

```bash
tart run --dir=project:~/src/project vm
```

Here, the `project` specifies a mount name, whereas the `~/src/project` is a path to the host's directory to expose to the VM.

It is also possible to mount directories in read-only mode by adding a third parameter, `ro`:

```bash
tart run --dir=project:~/src/project:ro vm
```

To mount multiple directories, repeat the `--dir` argument for each directory:

```bash
tart run --dir=www1:~/project1/www --dir=www2:~/project2/www
```

Note that the first parameter in each `--dir` argument must be unique, otherwise only the last `--dir` argument using that name will be used.

Note: to use the directory mounting feature, the host needs to run macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or newer.

### Accessing mounted directories in macOS guests

All shared directories are automatically mounted under `/Volumes/My Shared Files` inside a guest VM.
The `--dir=project` directory from above will be accessible from `/Volumes/My Shared Files/project`.

Note: to use the directory mounting feature, the guest VM needs to run macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or newer.

??? tip "Changing mount location"
    It is possible to remount the directories after a virtual machine is started by running the following commands:

    ```console
    admin@Manageds-Virtual-Machine:~$ sudo umount "/Volumes/My Shared Files"
    admin@Manageds-Virtual-Machine:~$ mkdir ~/workspace
    admin@Manageds-Virtual-Machine:~$ mount_virtiofs com.apple.virtio-fs.automount ~/workspace
    ```

    After running the above commands the direcory will be available at `~/workspace/project`

### Accessing mounted directories in Linux guests

To be able to access the shared directories from the Linux guest, you need to manually mount the virtual filesystem first:

```console
admin@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/shared
admin@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount -t virtiofs com.apple.virtio-fs.automount /mnt/shared
```

Once `/mnt/shared` is mounted inside a guest VM, the `--dir=project` directory from above will be accessible from `/mnt/shared/project`.

??? info "Auto-mount at boot time"
    To automatically mount this directory at boot time, add the following line to the `/etc/fstab` file:

    ```
    com.apple.virtio-fs.automount /mnt/shared virtiofs rw,relatime 0 0
    ```

## Working with a Remote OCI Container Registry

Tart supports interacting with Open Container Initiative (OCI) registries, but only runs images created and pushed by Tart. This means images created for container engines, like Docker, can't be pulled. Instead, create a custom image as documented above.

For example, let's say you want to push/pull images to an OCI registry hosted at `https://acme.io/`.

### Registry Authorization

First, you need to login to `acme.io` with the `tart login` command:

```bash
tart login acme.io
```

If you login to your registry with OAuth, you may need to create an access token to use as the password.
Credentials are securely stored in Keychain.

In addition, Tart supports [Docker credential helpers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers)
if defined in `~/.docker/config.json`.

Finally, `TART_REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `TART_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` environment variables allow to override authorization
for all registries, which might be useful for integrating with your CI's secret management.

You can also set the `TART_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME` environment variable to apply these overrides only to a specific host.

### Pushing a Local Image

Once credentials are saved for `acme.io`, run the following command to push a local images remotely with two tags:

```bash
tart push my-local-vm-name acme.io/remoteorg/name:latest acme.io/remoteorg/name:v1.0.0
```

### Pulling a Remote Image

You can either pull an image:

```bash
tart pull acme.io/remoteorg/name:latest
```

or create a VM from a remote image:

```bash
tart clone acme.io/remoteorg/name:latest my-local-vm-name
```

If the specified image is not already present, this invocation calls the `tart pull` implicitly before cloning.
