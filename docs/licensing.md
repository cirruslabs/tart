Both [Tart Virtualization](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) and [Orchard Orchestration](https://github.com/cirruslabs/orchard)
are licensed under [Fair Source License](https://fair.io/). Usage on personal computers including personal workstations is royalty-free,
but organizations that exceed a certain number of server installations (100 CPU cores for Tart and/or 4 hosts for Orchard)
will be required to obtain a paid license.

??? note "Host CPU Core usage"
    The virtual CPU cores of Tart VMs are not tied to specific physical cores of the host CPU. Instead, for optimal performance
    Tart VMs will automatically try to balance compute between all available cores of the host CPU. As a result,
    all performance and energy-efficient cores of the host CPU are always counted towards the license usage.

# License Tiers

## Free Tier

By default, when no [license is purchased](#get-the-license), it is assumed that an organization is using a Free Tier license.
You can find the Free Tier license text in [Tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/blob/main/LICENSE) and [Orchard](https://github.com/cirruslabs/orchard/blob/main/LICENSE) repositories.

Free Tier license has a 100 CPU core limit for Tart and 4 Orchard Workers limit for Orchard.

??? info "Usage Scenarios Examples"

    Here are a few examples that fit into the free tier:

      - Using Tart on 12 Mac Minis with 8 CPUs each running up to 24 VMs in parallel.
      - Creating an Orchard cluster of 4 Mac Studio workers with 24 CPUs each.

    Here are a few examples that do not fit into the free tier:

      - Using Tart on 13 Mac Minis with 8 CPUs each.
      - Creating an Orchard cluster of 5 Mac Minis workers with 8 CPUs each.
