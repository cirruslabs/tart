Both [Tart Virtualization](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) and [Orchard Orchestration](https://github.com/cirruslabs/orchard)
are licensed under [Fair Source License](https://fair.io/). Usage on personal computers including personal workstations is royalty-free,
but organizations that exceed a certain number of server installations (100 CPU cores for Tart and/or 4 hosts for Orchard)
will be required to obtain a paid license.

??? note "Performance and Efficiency Cores"
    The virtual CPU cores in Tart VMs do not differentiate between the high-performance  and high-efficient cores
    of the host CPU. Instead, Tart VMs automatically alternate between these types of cores depending on the workload
    being executed within the virtual machines. As a result, both performance and energy-efficient cores of the host CPU
    are treated equally in terms of licensing.

# License Tiers

When an organization surpasses the 100 CPU cores limit, it is required to obtain a Gold Tier License, which costs \$1000 per month.
Upon reaching a limit of 500 CPU cores, a Platinum Tier License (\$5000 per month) will be required, and for organizations
that exceed 5000 CPU cores, a custom Diamond Tier License (\$1 per core per month) will be necessary.

If your organization is interested in purchasing one of the license tiers, please email [licensing@cirruslabs.org](mailto:licensing@cirruslabs.org).
You can see a template of a license subscription agreement [here](assets/TartLicenseSubscription.pdf).

# General Support

The best way to ask general questions about particular use cases is to email our support team at [support@cirruslabs.org](mailto:support@cirruslabs.org).
Our support team is trying our best to respond ASAP, but there is no guarantee on a response time unless your organization
has a paid license subscription which includes [Priority Support](#priority-support).

If you have a feature request or noticed lack of some documentation please feel free to [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/issues/new).
Our support team will answer it by replying to the issue or by updating the documentation.

# Priority Support

In addition to the general support we provide a *Priority Support* with guaranteed response times included in all the paid license tiers.
