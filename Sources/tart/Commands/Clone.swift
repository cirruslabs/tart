    Creates a local virtual machine by cloning either a remote or another local virtual machine.

    Due to copy-on-write magic in Apple File System a cloned VM won't actually claim all the space right away.
    Only changes to a cloned disk will be written and claim new space. By default, Tart checks available capacity
    in Tart's home directory and checks if there is enough space for the worst possible scenario: when the whole disk
    will be modified.

    This behaviour can be disabled by setting TART_NO_AUTO_PRUNE environment variable. This might be helpful
    for use cases when the original image is very big and a workload is known to only modify a fraction of the cloned disk.
